"WASHINGTON — A coalition of abortion and civil rights groups are launching an effort Monday to put constitutional protections for abortion on Florida's ballot in next year's election. The ballot initiative seeks a state constitutional amendment to bar restrictions on abortion before fetal viability, considered to be at about the 24th week of pregnancy, undoing the state’s current 15-week ban and recently passed six-week ban, according to Planned Parenthood, which provided NBC News with a preview of the effort. ""No law shall prohibit, penalize, delay, or restrict abortion before viability or when necessary to protect the patient’s health, as determined by the patient’s healthcare provider,"" the ballot summary will say. ""This amendment does not change the Legislature’s constitutional authority to require notification to a parent or guardian before a minor has an abortion."" The ballot campaign was first reported by Politico. The groups behind the effort include Planned Parenthood affiliates, the ACLU of Florida, Florida Rising and Women's Voices of Southwest Florida. Representatives from the various organizations will unveil their effort Monday morning in Tallahassee. ""Floridians want the freedom to make their own personal health care decisions without interference from politicians, but the Legislature recently passed, and Gov. Ron DeSantis signed, a six-week abortion ban. That’s before many people even know they’re pregnant,"" said a media advisory for the event. ""The decision to have an abortion belongs to Floridians, their families, and those they trust — this campaign is an opportunity to ensure those protections remain in our state constitution,"" it added. The coalition is turning to Florida voters to try to overturn recent legislation signed by DeSantis, a Republican, that would ban most abortions after six weeks, with exemptions for rape and incest at up to 15 weeks of pregnancy. It does not change existing exceptions that aim to protect the life and the health of the mother at up to 15 weeks of pregnancy.",0
"Montana Rep. Zooey Zephyr said when debating SB99, ""If you vote yes on this bill and yes on these amendments I hope the next time there’s an invocation when you bow your heads in prayer, you see the blood on your hands."" Montana signed a slate of pro-life bills Wednesday intended to protect the unborn as well as medical providers who have ethical objections to abortion. ""Today, we stand together – on the steps of the people’s house – to mark another historic day for Montana,"" Gov. Gianforte said. ""Today, we are protecting the lives of the most vulnerable amongst us: unborn children."" The ceremony was broadcast live on the Republican's ""Today, we’re giving a voice to the voiceless, help to the helpless,"" the governor said, addressing Montana voters at the bill signing ceremony outside the state capitol. Prior to signing the legislation, Gianforte touted his, and other conservative Montana lawmakers' pro-life records. He claimed, ""You know me and you know how dedicated I am to the cause of life. Like you, I firmly believe that all life is precious and needs to be protected. I've been proud to stand with you for life before I was in public service and now as your governor. And I'm proud to stand with you today."" One notable bill Gianforte signed protects infants born alive following a failed abortion. House bill 625, The Infant Safety and Care Act, requires medical providers to give life-saving care to these infants. The bill, sponsored by Rep. Kerri Seekins-Crowe, R-Billing, recognizes these infants as legal persons deserving of medical care like any other newborn. A majority of Montana voters a similar referendum on the 2022 midterm ballot. The bill addresses some concerns opponents to the referendum had last fall, such as lessening penalties for practitioners who violate the law from criminal to civil, the governor's office said. ""A civilized society should never deny lifesaving, medically necessary care to any child born alive, including one who survives an attempted abortion,"" GOP sponsor Commenting on the bill at the ceremony, Gianforte declared, ""We must protect the lives of the innocent – little babies who are born alive following a botched abortion. Today we are giving a voiceless to the voiceless and help to the helpless. We're establishing in Montana law that a baby born alive following an attempted abortion is a patient, a human being who deserves life-saving care and the right to life."" A second bill, HB 303, will protect healthcare workers from being discriminated against if they refuse to assist in an abortion due to ethical, moral, or religious objections. Another bill signed on Wednesday was Senate Bill 154. The GOP bill clarifies the right to privacy under state law, does not mean the right to an abortion or state funding of abortion. The governor signed two other pro-life bills on Wednesday – House Bill 786 and House Bill 575. The former requires there to be reporting on all women in the state harmed by abortion drugs, such mifepristone. The governor claimed this bill will ""hold those distributing these drugs accountable and shed light on the consequences of this practice."" The latter bill prohibits abortions for unborn children past their point of 24 weeks, unless the mother's life is endangered by the pregnancy. GOP state Rep. Lola Sheldon-Galloway, who sponsored the last two bills signed by the governor Wednesday, gave a few words at the signing, saying, ""I'm a fighter for the unborn. I will always stand on that ground."" Commenting on HB 575, she declared, ""Our Constitution protects us at viability. That needed to be defined."" Two other bills awaiting the governor's signature prohibit taxpayer funds being used to pay for abortion, through a statewide adoption of the Hyde Amendment and a ban on elective abortions being covered through Medicaid. While the Hyde Amendment restricts the use of federal dollars for abortion except to save the life of the mother or in cases of incest or rape, it does not prohibit states from using its own funds to cover abortions. Other pro-life bills passed through the legislature include an adoption tax credit, a ban on dismemberment abortion, and increased oversight of abortion clinics. Under the proposed tax credit, Montana families would receive a $7,500 tax credit for each child adopted through the state's foster care system and $5,000. for a child adopted outside of it, on or after July 1, 2022. House bill 721 would ban dismemberment abortion, which is commonly called dilation and evacuation and used in second trimester abortions. The bill was sponsored by Rep. Matt Regier and has already received backlash from the abortion lobby. filed a preemptive lawsuit in April seeking to stop the legislation before it hit the governor's desk. The lawsuit argues that H.B. 721 ""violates the Montana Constitution, which as the Montana Supreme Court held more than two decades ago in the decision protects Montanans' right to privacy and access to pre-viability abortions,"" Planned Parenthood argued. The governor's office blasted the lawsuit in a statement. ""The fact that the bill hasn’t even come to the governor’s desk for his review and Planned Parenthood is already running to court tells Montanans everything they need to know about the far left, pro-abortion group and its extreme tactics,"" press secretary Kaitlin Price wrote. Several Republican-led states have enacted bans on abortion following the Supreme Court's 2022 ruling overturning . However, many of these state bans have been held up in the court system following lawsuits from abortion supporters.",1
"continued efforts to protect abortion rights Wednesday as the state Legislature advanced a bill that would outlaw companies from retaliating against employees for receiving abortions. The bill passed along party lines in the Michigan House after previously having been approved by the Senate in March. It would amend the state’s Elliott-Larsen Civil Rights act to prohibit employers from treating a worker differently for terminating a pregnancy. ""No one should lose their job or have to worry about their employment when making a decision that relates solely to their bodily autonomy,"" said Democratic Rep. Felicia Brabec of Ann Arbor. is expected to sign the legislation, and has emerged as a leader in the movement to protect abortion rights. Dr. Sarah Wallett, Michigan’s chief medical operating officer, testified in March during a Senate committee hearing in favor of the legislation. ""Whatever factors go into a person’s decision to end a pregnancy, it is certainly none of their bosses' business,"" Dr. Wallett said. ""Having an abortion has no impact on somebody's ability to perform a job."" It would be the second time this year that Democrats have amended the state's decades-old civil rights law. In March, Whitmer signed legislation that added LGBTQ+ protections by permanently outlawing discrimination on the basis of sexual orientation or gender identity. Since the fall of Roe last year, protecting abortion rights has been a priority for Michigan Democrats, who control both chambers of the Legislature and the governor’s office. In last November's midterms, voters overwhelmingly approved a ballot measure that enshrined abortion rights in the state's Constitution. Republicans who spoke out against the bill prior to the vote were opposed to legality of abortion as a whole and said it could be an infringement of religious freedoms. The Michigan Catholic Conference, the public policy arm of the in Michigan, said in a statement that they were in ""strong opposition"" to the legislation. The Elliott-Larsen Civil Rights Act prohibits discrimination in employment, housing and public services based on religion, race, color, national origin, age, sex, height, weight, familial status or marital status.

"North Carolina lawmakers this week approved dozens of bills in a marathon legislative session as state Republicans continued riding a wave of momentum in the aftermath of a high-profile defection of a Democratic legislator. The state Senate on Thursday passed legislation that would ban most abortions after 12 weeks of pregnancy, making exceptions for rape, incest, fetal abnormality, or danger to the life of the mother. North Carolina law currently allows abortion up to 20 weeks. The vote came about 24 hours after the state House passed the abortion bill along with dozens of others in a marathon voting session that stretched into late Wednesday night. Lawmakers took up 56 bills to meet a deadline after which legislation not involving appropriations or revenue or not part of a legislative study isn't eligible to be passed by the other chamber for the remainder of the 2023-24 legislative session. For its part, the Senate acted on another dozen bills. The abortion measure, which includes increased payments for foster care families and greater funding for childcare centers that aid low-income families, now goes to the desk of Democratic Gov. Roy Cooper, who promised to veto it in a statement on Thursday. However, Republicans now have a veto-proof supermajority in both chambers of the state legislature thanks to state Rep. Tricia Cotham, who announced last month that she was joining the Republican Party after serving her deep blue Charlotte-area district as a Democrat. While North Carolina Republicans already held strong majorities, Cotham's decision gave Republicans a supermajority in the House in what observers described as a ""political earthquake."" The threat of a veto from Cooper, who has vetoed more than 75 measures since taking office in 2017, had prevented Republicans from implementing much of their agenda. But now the GOP has a clearer path to push a wide range of legislation — including on abortion. Cotham's vote may prove critical in potentially overriding Cooper's expected veto. While the newly minted Republican previously promised to codify Roe v. Wade in her state and has taken more liberal positions on other social issues, she voted in favor of the abortion ban this week. The state Senate also has a GOP supermajority. Beyond abortion, Cotham has taken the lead in pushing Republican-backed measures to expand school choice and implement other conservative reforms to education. One such bill that passed the House this week is designed to provide equal funding for charter school students as well as those attending traditional public schools. It would change the current factors which determine per-pupil funding that public school districts must share with local charter schools, with proponents arguing money should follow the student if their family chooses to attend a charter school. Another bill currently pending in both chambers that has full GOP support in the House would expand the state's school voucher program and existing Opportunity Scholarships — which are designed to allow low- and moderate-income families to attend the private school of their choice — to all students to attend private schools or cover educational expenses through a tiered system based on income. ""This is about putting kids first, about empowering families, and about changing education in North Carolina to benefit everyone across the state,"" Cotham said this week. ""At the end of the day, it's about putting kids first — not adults, not systems, not bureaucrats, but children."" As chair of the Education K-12 House Standing Committee, Cotham is in a prime position to influence education reform bills that come out of the House.",1
"After the US Supreme Court overturned Roe v. Wade in June, an obstetrician who works at a hospital in the Northeast thought she could make a difference by publicly describing what she was seeing, by telling the stories of the patients she saw suffering in the aftermath of the court’s historic court ruling. So when a reporter from The New York Times reached out, she was grateful for the opportunity to discuss the plight of patients traveling to her hospital from states that had abortion restrictions. Abortion rights activists participate in an impromptu demonstration outside of the the U.S. Supreme Court in Washington, D.C., US, on Monday, June 27 2022. Photographer: Sarah Silbiger/CNN Abortion is a key motivator for US voters in midterm elections, new survey finds The obstetrician passed along the reporter’s inquiry to her hospital’s public relations office, asking for permission to do the interview, noting that the reporter approached her because she holds a leadership position on a state government maternal mortality committee. A hospital PR official replied that “without any notable exceptions, we are not participating in interviews at this time” and asked the doctor to send along the reporter’s questions and her proposed answers. The doctor sent along the questions and answers and received a resounding “no” from the PR official: “We ask that you do not comment to the NY Times at this time.” “They’re censoring me,” the doctor told CNN. “It’s shameful and embarrassing to work for an institution that is not supportive of women’s rights. “I’m extremely angry,” she added. “It’s disgusting.” A physician in another state echoed her: “I feel shackled. I feel muzzled. I feel completely restrained, and I’m outraged.” The US Supreme Court building stands in Washington, DC, on October 3, 2022. - The Supreme Court begins their new term today, and is expected to hear cases addressing a number of issues, including affirmative action, Alabamas congressional map, immigration, LGBTQ protections, and the authority of the Environmental Protection Agency. Supreme Court declines to hear fetal personhood case These two doctors, and six others interviewed by CNN, say their employers – major public and private medical centers in five states – have asked them to not speak publicly about abortion, or have instructed them that if they do speak publicly about abortion, they can do so only as private citizens and cannot mention where they work. Even when they are permitted to speak about abortion as private citizens, these doctors say, their employers have made it clear that they would prefer the doctors not talk at all, and so they have hesitated to speak up. “If [they] don’t speak up, who is going to provide the evidence about the effect [abortion bans are] having on patients?” asked Dr. Erika Werner, who chairs the health policy and advocacy committee at the Society for Maternal-Fetal Medicine and is the chair of obstetrics and gynecology at Tufts Medical Center in Boston. Dr. Eric Rubin, editor in chief of The New England Journal of Medicine, said doctors need to be able to speak up because “the world of medicine in general – and certainly abortion – is full of misinformation, and we have not found good ways to counter that.” An operating room sits empty at Alamo Women's Reproductive Services, an abortion clinic that closed its doors following the overturn of Roe v.

Dr. Rosha McCoy, acting chief health care officer at the Association of American Medical Colleges, said medical centers and universities are having to deal with a great deal of “fear” and “confusion” in the aftermath of new abortion limitations. “They don’t want themselves or the physicians to be put in a position where something is said that could be interpreted that’s going to cause a problem for both the clinician and/or the institution,” said McCoy, whose group represents more than 400 teaching hospitals and health care systems. “We would never support doctors being censored,” she added. “I’m hoping it’s not censorship as much as a protective desire.”",0
"Thursday was a sad day for Floridians like Estefany Londoño, who have long advocated for abortion rights in their home state, as the possibility of a six-week abortion ban going into effect later this year started to sink in."" It's heartbreaking,"" Londoño, 26, said. ""People should be able to make those decisions when they’re ready and not because they're forced into certain situations."" Latinas and Black women working to keep abortions accessible in Florida worry the new law will result in more people of color being forced to carry unwanted pregnancies to term — which often results in worse economic and mental health outcomes. While women of reproductive age of all races and ethnicities are at risk of unintended pregnancy, Hispanic and Black women face a disproportionally higher risk, according to research published in 2020 in the peer-reviewed journal Contraception and Reproductive Medicine. “The conditions of our state, people not being able to afford abortion care, these are going to keep people pregnant against their will, ultimately,” Florida Access Network co-executive director Stephanie Loraine Piñeiro, who heads the only abortion fund led by queer people of color in the state, said. The law signed by Gov. Ron DeSantis Thursday night will take effect only if Florida’s current 15-week ban is upheld in an ongoing legal challenge that is before the state Supreme Court. Bienvenido US, a Hispanic conservative national group, celebrated the news on Friday calling it “A PRO LIFE VICTORY!” on Twitter. The Radiance Foundation, a faith-based nonprofit group founded by African American anti-abortion rights activist Ryan Bomberger, shared a post on Facebook celebrating the abortion ban saying, “We won’t stop this #humanrights fight until every life is protected from the violence of abortion and the predators who profit from fear and pain.” Florida is home to 828,100 Black women of reproductive age. Among the 1.4 million Latinas of reproductive age, 570,000 are economically insecure and 585,200 are already mothers, according to a November report. For Black and brown people in the state, giving birth can present an additional set of dangers and concerns given its high rates of maternal mortality. Some also face systemic barriers such as lack of heath insurance, health care literacy and access to culturally and linguistically competent health systems, as well as ""discriminatory policies that make it difficult for people to access routine health care,"" Aurelie Colón-Larrauri, the Florida state policy advocate for the National Latina Institute for Reproductive Justice, said ""Forcing anyone in marginalized communities to continue their pregnancy, because they cannot terminate them, may actually contribute to an increase of maternal mortality rates in the state of Florida,"" Colón-Larrauri said.",0

""Forcing anyone in marginalized communities to continue their pregnancy, because they cannot terminate them, may actually contribute to an increase of maternal mortality rates in the state of Florida,"" Colón-Larrauri said. Colón-Larrauri and Piñero worry about how many people will forgo abortion care because they can’t travel or afford the procedure. ""This six-week abortion ban is effectively a total ban,"" Piñero said, adding that it's often not enough time for people to find out they are pregnant, figure out how to pay for the procedure, secure traveling and lodging logistics, and in some cases child care. ""It’s not realistic, and that’s by design,"" she added. A recentTurnaway Studyfrom demographerDiana Greene Foster, a professor of obstetrics, gynecology and reproductive sciences at the University of California San Francisco, found that women who had been denied abortion access experienced worse economic and mental health outcomes than women who had received care and that 95% of study participants who received abortions said they made the right decision. The new Florida law contains some exceptions, including to save the woman’s life. Abortions for pregnancies involving rape or incest would be allowed until 15 weeks of pregnancy, provided a woman has documentation like a restraining order or police report. In the work Jamarah Amani has done as the executive director of the Southern Birth Justice Network and member of the coalition Black in Repro, she has witnessed how these exceptions ""don’t actually play out in the way that we think they will."" She has seen it with the 15-week abortion ban currently in place. ""There have been situations where people have had to go to other states, or they’ve had to carry pregnancies against their will, because they didn’t have proper documentation,"" Amani, who is also a midwife, said. In cases where the woman's life is at risk, Amani worries about doctors waiting too long to act on behalf of their pregnant patients because it's not always clear how at-risk patients need to be in order for doctors to avoid litigation, criminal penalties or even losing their licenses. ""These further restrictions placed on abortion care make a medically safe practice legally dangerous, and endangers the lives in the process,"" Colón-Larrauri said. Thebill also includes $25 millionto expand Florida Pregnancy Care Network Inc., a statewide system of nonprofit groups that provides services by often subcontracting with crisis pregnancy centers, which areknown to provide inaccurate or misleading information about abortionsto pregnant people. ""What we need is investments in legitimate health care,"" Amani said,  ""and abortion funds to help people get those early abortions, which will hopefully still be legal."" As advocates wait for a Florida court to determine the fate of the new abortion ban, theFlorida Access Networkwill continue debunking the rising abortion misinformation that often follows when a new law is passed and ramp up fundraising efforts to be ready for an increase in patients that may need to travel outside of Florida to get the procedure, Piñeiro said. After Texas passed its six-week abortion law months ago, many independent abortion clinics shut down or ended up drastically increasing their prices. Piñeiro fears the same will happen in Florida. ""The abortion care people will need is getting appointments and tangibly helping them pay for travel,"" Piñeiro said. As a mother raising Black children, Amani worries about how these laws are reviving a painful legacy in which ""our ancestors were forced to breed and not being able to decide anything about their bodies."" ""It’s just crazy that in 2023, I’m handing that world, again, to my children,"" she said. ""It's a matter of life and death, and we want our lives. ""People that are in power should not be able to make death sentence decisions for any group of people,"" Amani added. Londoño agreed. © 2023 NBC UNIVERSAL",0
"While local advocates in favor of abortion access loudly vented their outrage over the U.S. Supreme Court ruling Friday that overturned a national right to the procedure, Washington state’s anti-abortion advocates cheered the ruling in a rather subdued fashion. Some issued statements of support after the court struck down Roe v. Wade, but there was no immediate celebration of this long-sought after conservative win, which gives each state the ability to set its own abortion laws. That’s at least in part because state law enshrines the right to an abortion in Washington. The ruling doesn’t hold the same meaning here that it does in states such as Idaho, where a trigger law renders abortion illegal effective July 24. And that caveat resulted in a less enthusiastic response from some corners of the anti-abortion movement. Esther Ripplinger, executive director of Human Life of Washington, an offshoot of the National Right to Life Committee that has long lobbied to make abortion illegal, called the monumental court decision “bittersweet.” Ripplinger said her reaction to the ruling was “not so much joy, but gratefulness for justice. For me, it’s a time to commemorate the lives of unborn children, including my own … I’m wearing pink to commemorate the life of my unborn child Nina.” Ripplinger was 19, living in Portland a few weeks away from starting college with plans to marry her boyfriend, when they learned she was pregnant. Her boyfriend’s parents insisted she get an abortion and she agreed. Ripplinger said she has been beset with regret ever since, leading to struggles to control her temper and overindulgence in alcohol during triggering times, like the anniversary of her abortion. Even on a day when her side got the biggest win of its half-century fight against legal abortion, the rage surfaced in Ripplinger’s voice when she described the merits of legal abortion as “a trap” that isn’t helping women, but “pushing them off a cliff” toward the symptoms of trauma that follow. “Bringing healing to the women and men involved in abortion who regret their decisions is part of my mission,” she said. Some pregnancy centers and anti-abortion organizations reached Friday deadpanned responses. Step by Step is a pregnancy center in Puyallup that discourages abortion and provides services to new mothers when they opt to give birth. An employee who answered the phone declined to give her name and would only say “There’s not a big, strong reaction down here, honestly.” Senate Minority Leader John Braun, R-Centralia, offered a generally neutral statement, noting the U.S. Supreme Court ruling will not affect the law in Washington state. “Better support for pregnant women who choose to give birth should be a common goal for all of us, regardless of our politics,” he said. “Compassion and empathy, rather than hostility, should be the universal approach. I’m hoping this is how we all move forward.” In a written statement signed by Seattle Archbishop Paul D. Etienne and others, the Washington State Catholic Conference commended the Supreme Court’s decision to overturn Roe and said the Catholic Church welcomes “an opportunity to reduce the number of abortions in the U.S. and build a culture of life.” Julie Barrett, founder of Conservative Ladies of Washington, said, “I am pleased with the decision.” Overturning Roe is in line with the Constitution, she said, because it returns the abortion issue to elected state leaders. Though she noted that means abortion remains legal in this state. For Barrett, the court’s decision doesn’t limit women’s choices. “Motherhood is not obligatory,” Barrett said. “We are not educating people about the choices they have, like adoption. You don’t hear people talking about how to prevent pregnancies in the first place. “I had an unplanned pregnancy at a very early age. I was 15 minutes away from an abortion, but I backed off. Now that kid is 26.” Barrett was a bit more willing to note this milestone than other advocates in Washington. She said, “People I have been in contact with are really happy. Christians around the country have been praying for this for 50 years. It is a great cause for celebration.”",1
"Approximately 25,000 people took to the streets in Mexico City April 29 for the March for Life to demand an end to abortion, which was legalized in the Mexican capital in 2007, according to Steps for Life, the organizer of the event. April 26 marks 16 years since the Legislative Assembly of the Federal District legalized abortion with a reform of the Penal Code. At that time Marcelo Ebrard headed the government of the capital and supported decriminalization, which was known as “the Marcelo Law.” “This legislation has caused more than a million abortions in Mexico, since the official figures from health centers in Mexico City must be added [to] those performed in private clinics,” Steps for Life said in a press release. At approximately 11:15 a.m. the demonstration headed to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs to place a wreath near the Memory and Tolerance Museum symbolizing “the deaths caused by the so-called ‘Marcelo Law’ and the systematic violence experienced by women,” explained Jahel Torres Ramírez, spokeswoman and organizer of the march. The thousands of pro-life marchers then made their way to the Mexico City Congress, where they listened to speeches by the organizers. Daniel Ramírez Cortés, who represents Steps for Life in Michoacán state, noted that current public policies don’t solve the real problems of Mexican women, who need “better education, more job opportunities, safety guarantees, day care for their children, sports, culture, not death.” Fátima Guzmán, the representative of Steps for Life in Jalisco state, pointed out that in recent years it has been proven that decriminalizing abortion doesn’t solve the problems at their source. “It’s not a comprehensive solution, women are not better cared for, the risks in the practice [of abortion] haven’t ended,” she said. Guzmán asked politicians “to open their eyes and realize that Mexico wants life and not unjust laws that promote systematic violence against women and society.” Organizer Jahel Torres demanded that the three branches of government “respect the laws, respect the binding international treaties to which Mexico is a party, and promote the culture of life, the culture of an authentic defense of women for a better development of our country.” The pro-lfe leader stressed “that this Mexico of women, this Mexico of life, this Mexico of opportunities, is the Mexico that we are building this day and that we are committed to defending and spreading because Mexico loves life!” This story was first published by ACI Prensa, CNA’s Spanish-language news partner.

"Pope Francis spoke out strongly against abortion and gender ideology Friday, citing both as examples of “ideological colonization” during a speech in Budapest. The pope’s denunciation came during an addressto civil authoritiesand other dignitaries at a former Carmelite monastery in Hungary’s capital in which he lamented “self-referential forms of populism” and “supranationalism” gaining traction in Europe. “This is the baneful path taken by those forms of ‘ideological colonization’ that would cancel differences, as in the case of the so-called gender theory, or that would place before the reality of life reductive concepts of freedom, for example by vaunting as progress a senseless ‘right to abortion,’ which is always a tragic defeat,” said the pope, who is in Budapest for a three-day visit. “How much better it would be to build a Europe centered on the human person and on its peoples, with effective policies for natality and the family — policies that are pursued attentively in this country — a Europe whose different nations would form a single family that protects the growth and uniqueness of each of its members,” the Holy Father said. Before his address, Pope Francis met with Hungary’s President Katalin Novák and Prime Minister Viktor Orbán, whose family-centered initiatives, including government bonuses of $33,000 for married couples who have three children, have helped boost the country’s birth rate. Abortion is legal in Hungary up to the first 12 weeks of pregnancy and is permissible up to 24 weeks under certain conditions. Under a newdecreeissued last year, women seeking an abortion must first listen to a fetal heartbeat.",1
"Catholic and pro-life leaders lamented Colorado Gov. Jared Polis’ final approval of three strongly pro-abortion bills on Friday, objecting that they prioritize abortion “at the cost of countless children’s lives.” The new laws ban abortion-pill reversal treatments, greatly restrict advertising for pro-life pregnancy resource centers, require insurance providers to pay for abortions, and remove parental notification for minors seeking an abortion, among other measures. Bella Health and Wellness, a pro-life, Catholic-founded health care clinic that provides abortion pill reversal, quickly filed a legal challenge to the abortion pill reversal ban, with the backing of the religious liberty legal group Becket. If it continues to offer and advertise progesterone for abortion pill reversal, the clinic faces up to $20,000 in fines per violation and the loss of providers’ medical licenses. The new laws also forbid medical facilities and insurance provider networks from terminating or excluding medical professionals who perform abortions or provide “gender-affirming care,” with some exceptions for religious organizations opposed to these practices. In an April 14 letter, the Catholic bishops of Colorado said there was “a strong outcry” against the three bills. They said the laws are out of step with the 63% of Coloradans who do not support unrestricted abortion. Most residents do not want to pay for abortion in their health insurance and do not want to penalize health care providers who object to abortion and “gender-affirming care.” Democratic Gov. Polis and the “near-veto-proof majority of pro-abortion lawmakers” in the Legislature, the bishops said, are “telling Coloradans that they prioritize abortion over life-affirming reproductive health care decisions for women, at the expense of the mother’s health and, even more grave, at the cost of countless children’s lives.” They lamented that some Catholic legislators had voted for the bills and asked them to refrain from holy Communion until they show public repentance and receive absolution in sacramental confession. “The tears of God fell on Denver today as our governor signed three extreme abortion bills into law, choosing a culture of death over a culture of life,” Archbishop Samuel Aquila of Denver said on Twitter April 14. “Let us continue to pray for the conversion of hearts and minds and the courage to defend the dignity of life!” The provision banning abortion pill reversal (APR), according to the bishops, “even removes a woman’s ability to choose life for her unborn child.” “APR is simply a large dose of natural progesterone, the ‘pro-gestation’ hormone, prescribed by a licensed medical provider to outcompete the life-ending effects of chemically induced abortion for the baby,” the bishops said. “Babies who have been born to mothers who have taken progesterone during pregnancy are healthy and strong. Colorado is the first state to eliminate this choice of life for women.” The abortion pill is a two-dose regimen of mifepristone followed by misoprostol. The pill works to kill an unborn baby by cutting off the nutrients necessary for it to continue developing. A second drug, misoprostol, taken days after the first, induces cramping and contractions to expel the baby’s body from the womb. Though the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) had only approved the abortion pill until 10 weeks into pregnancy, many clinics and providers offer the drug up to 12 or 13 weeks into pregnancy, the New York Times reported. The FDA approval of the abortion pill is currently facing scrutiny in the federal courts and approved use has been rolled back to seven weeks into pregnancy. Critics of the abortion pill reversal regimen said it lacks FDA approval and robust scientific support. The pro-abortion American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists, in a 2015 position paper, said that pregnancy will continue in 30%-50% of women who take mifepristone alone and do not take the follow-up drug misoprostol. The reversal regimen has the backing of the American Association of Pro-Life Obstetricians and Gynecologists, which cites drug development literature and the routine use of progesterone in care for pregnant women and in-vitro fertilization treatment. “Even though Bella can offer the hormone to women in any other circumstance, including natural miscarriage, it is barred [under the new law] from doing so if the purpose is to reverse the effects of the abortion pill,” Bella said in an April 14 statement. “This forces pro-life clinics to choose between their deeply held religious beliefs and their ability to operate as health care ministries in the state.” Dede Chism, a nurse practitioner and co-founder and CEO at Bella Health and Wellness, said in the statement that the founders of Bella opened the medical clinic “because of our belief that life is a precious gift from God, worthy of protection at all stages.” “When a woman seeks our help to reverse the effects of the abortion pill, we have a religious obligation to offer every available option for her and her child,” Chism said. The Colorado bishops praised the legal challenge, saying it “affirms the First Amendment rights of pregnancy centers and the ability of medical providers to freely prescribe APR treatment as a life-affirming option for women in Colorado.” The other two bills have “serious First Amendment violations,” the bishops said. As examples, they noted the end to notification for parents of a minor seeking abortion, compelled inclusion of abortion costs in insurance premiums, compelling medical centers to include those who perform abortions or provide “gender-affirming” care, and forcing private employers to pay for abortion and “gender-affirming” care in their health care plans. “We will also support filings against these unjust laws,” the bishops said. A provision targeting pro-life pregnancy centers characterizes them as “anti-abortion centers.” It bars “false advertising relating to the provision of abortion or emergency contraceptive services, or referrals for those services,” though it is not clear what constitutes “false advertising.” Crisis pregnancy centers offer pregnant women and families free resources and baby materials. Some provide health care or referrals. The legislation described them as “the ground-level presence of a well-coordinated anti-choice movement.” Abortion advocates have long opposed the centers and contend that some present themselves as abortion providers to attract women considering abortion. Advocates against the bills included Pro-Life Colorado, a coalition of over 36 pro-life organizations. More than 60 representatives of pregnancy resource centers advocated against the bills. In the wake of the new laws, the state’s bishops reaffirmed their resolve. “We, the Catholic bishops of Colorado, and our three dioceses are committed to do our part to advocate for the sanctity of life, freedom of conscience and expression, and will continue to assist pregnant mothers and families experiencing unexpected pregnancies through the ongoing expansion of medical services, housing, counseling, and resources, both during their pregnancy and after,” they said. Colorado lawmakers had passed strong pro-abortion legislation in the 2022 Reproductive Health Equity Act, which declared abortion a “fundamental right” and stripped all rights from the unborn child from the point of conception, saying a fertilized egg, embryo, or fetus has “no independent or derivative rights” under state law.",1
"Since a federal judge’s Friday ruling called the legality of the abortion drug mifepristone into question, the governors of New York, Washington, Massachusetts, and California revealed they have begun stockpiling years’ worth of chemical abortion supplies for use in their states. In the case that last week’s ruling suspending the FDA’s abortion pill approval is upheld by higher courts, these four governors intend to have a surplus of abortion drugs on hand. “I want to assure Washington women that mifepristone will remain available in the state of Washington,” Washington Gov. Jay Inslee said on Friday. “The Texas judge’s decision, while unfortunate, will not stop us from making this product available to Washington women who exercise their right of choice … This is an important right; it will be protected in the state of Washington.” By ordering the Washington Department of Corrections to make the purchase, Inslee obtained 30,000 doses, or what he is calling a three-year supply, of mifepristone. Mifepristone is the first pill in what is commonly a two-step regimen for a chemical abortion. The drug works by cutting off the nutrients necessary for a growing unborn child to survive. A second drug, misoprostol, is then ingested 48 hours later to expel the dead baby. Since mifepristone was approved by the FDA for use up to 10 weeks into pregnancy in 2000, chemical abortions have grown increasingly common, to the point that they now account for over half of U.S. abortions. The abortion debate erupted anew last week after contradictory rulings from federal judges in Texas and Washington called the continued legality of mifepristone into question.The issue is currently being worked out in the judiciary. Rather than waiting for the outcome, the governors in these three states have taken matters into their own hands. In Massachusetts, Gov. Maura Healey announced on Monday that the state, through the University of Massachusetts, has ordered 15,000 doses of mifepristone. In anexecutive orderalso released Monday, Healey reaffirmed the state’s stance in support of mifepristone access and directed Massachusetts universities to expedite plans to make abortion drugs readily available. “Mifepristone has been a safe and effective FDA-approved medication for over 20 years,” Healey said in a Monday press conference. “In Massachusetts, we are not going to tolerate this … medication abortion will remain safe, legal, and accessible here in the Commonwealth.” Meanwhile, the governors of New York and California have taken a slightly different approach. California Gov. Gavin Newsom announced Monday that the state has stockpiled 2 million misoprostol pills for abortion use in anticipation of a ban on mifepristone. On Tuesday, New York Gov. Kathy Hochul announced that the state Department of Health is preparing to purchase a five-year supply of misoprostol. While the typical chemical abortion regimen involves ingesting both mifepristone and misoprostol, abortion proponents have begun suggesting misoprostol alone could be used to achieve an abortion. The World Health Organization stated in a2018 reporttitled “Medical management of abortion” that “misoprostol is particularly useful [for abortion] in low-resource settings” and that “the use of misoprostol within abortion care — either in combination with mifepristone or alone — offers several advantages. It reduces the need for skilled surgical abortion providers, equipment, sterilization, and anesthesia while offering a noninvasive and highly acceptable option to pregnant individuals.” However, there is significant debate as to whether it is safe for women to use misoprostol alone for an abortion. Dr. Ingrid Skop, an OB-GYN and vice president of the Charlotte Lozier Institute, told CNA that claims that misoprostol is only slightly less effective than the two-pill regimen is a “vast exaggeration.” “[Misoprostol alone] is way less effective. A meta-analysis shows that 22% of women who take misoprostol alone will fail to have a complete abortion and they will require surgery,” Skop said. “And the surgery is not the same as if they had chosen surgical abortion in the first place; in many cases these women bleed a lot before they finally receive care, the dead tissue in their uterus can become infected and that infection can scar their uterus and lead to future infertility or future pregnancy complications.” The study mentioned by Skop can be found on the National Institutes of Health’sNational Library of Medicine website. Notably, despite admitting 22% of women included in the study had to undergo surgical abortions after taking misoprostol alone, the study concludes that “misoprostol alone is effective and safe and is a reasonable option for women seeking abortion in the first trimester.” “So, recommending misoprostol, if the abortion industry continues to do this, is going to show without a shadow of a doubt that they do not care for women, that they merely care for ending unborn human life,” Skop added.",1
"A new poll shows that a pro-life amendment on the ballot in Kansas is enjoying a narrow lead. The August 2 referendum represents the first major statewide vote on abortion following the overturning of Roe v. Wade. The survey, conducted byco/efficientand shared byFiveThirtyEight, found that 47% of likely primary voters in Kansas say they plan to vote for the pro-life amendment, 43% say they plan to vote against it, and 10% are undecided. The amendment needs a simple majority of 51% to pass. The poll surveyed 1,557 likely Kansas primary voters from July 17-18 through mobile text response and automated landline interviews. It has a margin of error of +/- 2.78%. Kansas citizenswill vote on the pro-life amendment, also known as the “Value Them Both” amendment, during their state’s primary election. The amendment would reverse the Kansas Supreme Court’s2019 rulingthat the state’s constitution protects a woman’s “right” to abortion. Currently, state lawmakers are, in most cases, prohibited from passing any type of abortion restriction. The amendment, if approved by voters, would enable state lawmakers to pass legislation to regulate or restrict abortion. The vote will have broad implications that extend past Kansas’ borders. It could indicate how other states will vote on abortion after the Supreme Court’s ruling in Dobbs v. Jackson — which overturned Roe and left abortion policy up to the states — and suggest where Americans stand on abortion ahead of the midterm elections in November. It could also determine whether Kansas serves as an abortion hub for women in neighboring states that restrict abortion. Mackenzie Haddix, the deputy communications director for the Value Them Both Coalition, applauded the poll’s findings. The coalition in support of the amendment is led by Kansans for Life, the Kansas Catholic Conference, and Kansas Family Voice. “We’re encouraged because we know Kansans do not support the radical pro-abortion agenda of the left,” Haddix told CNA. “These poll results are further evidence that voters reject a future that includes a 1,000% increase in abortions paid for with our tax dollars and understand Value Them Both must be passed to avoid this increase.” According to the Guttmacher Institute, abortions could increase by more than 1,000% in Kansas as neighboring states restrict the procedure, theKansas City Starpreviously reported. Archbishop Joseph Naumann of Kansas City in Kansas, the former chairman of the U.S. bishops’ pro-life committee, also responded positively to the findings. “I am encouraged that according to the poll more Kansans support the passage of Value Them Both than oppose it, despite the avalanche of deceptive advertising funded by the abortion industry that attempts to confuse voters,” he told CNA. “This is a tribute to the prayers and hard work of the many dedicated Value Them Both volunteers.” The new poll breaks down the results by political party and finds that, of Republican likely primary voters in Kansas, 68% plan to vote yes to the amendment, 18% plan to vote no, and 14% are undecided. Of Democrats, 10% plan to vote yes, 86% plan to vote no, and 4% are undecided. Kansas likely voters also chose which statements best reflected their understanding of the amendment. Thirty-one percent said it will allow Kansas to ban abortion, 30% said it clarifies that there is no right to an abortion in the Kansas Constitution, and 31% said it protects women's healthcare by ensuring that the state can create guidelines for abortion. Ryan Munce, president of co/efficient, explained the reasoning behind the three options. “After reviewing the messaging and narratives of the media and campaigns both for and against the amendment, we came up with those three ‘buckets’ of interpretation,” Munce told CNA. “We thought that would give us a good read of how the messaging is working, and how perception is being shaped about the amendment.” He called it “certainly surprising” that the data came back with all three statements receiving an almost identical share of the electorate. “Democrats are three times as likely to believe that the amendment is intended to create an outright ban on abortion in the state, than Republicans,” he pointed out. “While a strong majority of Republicans interpret the amendment in a different way.” Haddix said of the various options: “I would just reiterate that the amendment is not a ban on abortion, but rather allows us to restore commonsense limits on the abortion industry that Kansans already agree on.” As the spokesperson for the coalition working to oppose the amendment, Ashley All of Kansans for Constitutional Freedom accused the amendment’s supporters of wanting to “ultimately ban abortion completely with no exceptions.” She responded to CNA about the poll’s findings by predicting a “close race.” She regretted that the vote will take place during the primary election instead of the general election in November, claiming that the amendment’s backers “hope fewer Kansans vote.” Of the likely voters, 86% said they were familiar with the ""Value Them Both"" constitutional amendment that will be on the ballot August 2. Only 7% said they were not. A large majority (84%) said that the amendment increased the importance of voting in this upcoming election, including 78% of Republicans and 94% of Democrats. Naumann stressed to CNA that “the only poll that really matters is the decision of Kansas voters from now to August 2nd.” “I encourage every Pro-Life Kansan from every corner of the State to vote YES in favor of the Value Them Both Amendment,” he said. “The fate of Value Them Both will be decided by those who show up on election day.” Of likely Kansas primary voters, the co/efficient poll found that 49% agreed with the Supreme Court's decision to overturn Roe v. Wade, while 46% disagreed. A plurality of Kansas voters (33%) said that there should be no government restrictions on abortion, while 9% said abortion should be banned under any circumstance.In the middle, 24% said abortion should only be allowed in cases of rape, incest, or to save the life of the mother, while 14% said non-medically necessary abortion in Kansas should be legal but not past viability of the fetus. Ten percent said abortion should only be legal to save the life of the mother. And 7% said non-medically necessary abortion in Kansas should be legal but not after a heartbeat is detected. Editor's note: This story was updated on July 22 to reflect co/efficient's adjusted poll numbers regarding likely Kansas primary voters' positions on abortion.",1
"The Supreme Court overturned Roe v. Wade on Friday morning, turning the legality of abortion rights over to states to decide. We’ve failed to keep abortion a constitutional right because we’ve made abortion a women’s issue when it is everyone’s issue. It’s time pro-choice advocates change our strategy. I was 5 in 1973, when the Supreme Court passed Roe. But the decision was never a complete safeguard for women. I grew up watching as state and federal laws restricted access, especially for poor women and women of color. In high school, my mom took me to Washington to the March for Women’s Lives. We chanted, ""Keep your laws off my body."" This was a women’s issue, we thought. And how could it not be? After all, pregnancy was happening to our bodies. The year before I graduated from college in 1990, the Supreme Court ruled inWebster v. Reproductive Health Servicesthat certain state abortion restrictions were not unconstitutional. As I was becoming an adult, taking control of my life, women’s autonomy was being taken away, state by state. I got pissed. No state lawmaker would tell me what I could do with my body. I took this conviction to the extreme and organized theReproductive Freedom Ride. In the summer of 1991, I bicycled across the country with a band of activists demanding reproductive justice, including access to safe, legal abortion. We used ourselves, our physical power, as a manifestation of our argument. We saw, up close, the real-life consequences of restrictions on abortions. In Indiana, we met the parents ofBecky Bell, a 17-year-old who died because of a state-enacted parental consent law. Bell felt like she couldn’t tell her religious parents she was pregnant, so she got an abortion on her own, developed an infection and died. In Fargo, North Dakota, we met Dr. Miriam McCreary, who flew in from Minnesota once a week to provide abortions in North Dakota’s lone clinic. She flew around the country providing abortions into her 70s. Today, parental consent or notification laws are still on the books in Indiana and 36 other states. Doctors have stepped in for McCreary, but there’s still only one abortion clinic in North Dakota. The next closest clinic is in Minnesota, 225 miles away. We biked, marched and held news conferences. Our message: “We’re biking 4,000 miles to show the world women can and will control our bodies.” We told men to back off. This was our fight. But by telling men to shut up, we made a grave error. Women barely held political power, and we let men off the hook. Today, women stilldon’t hold enough political power. They make up about 51.1% of the population, but just 27% of the U.S. Congress and 31% of state legislatures. We’re still marching, still chanting “Bans Off Our Bodies,” couching this issue as ours alone. We’ve used the same argument for 50 years. But for every woman seeking an abortion, there’s a man responsible for that unwanted pregnancy. We need them in this fight. In early May when adraft of the Supreme Court’s decision on Roe was leaked, I was talking to Ida Dupont, one of my fellow Reproductive Freedom Riders, who is now a professor. She was teaching a class on sexuality and reproductive justice and, of course, the possibility of Roe being overturned came up. She faced her class and said, ""Listen, I’m not supposed to say this..."" Then she got nervous. A feeling of shame swept over her because she thought her students would think she did something terrible — though she didn’t think she did. After giving some statistics on how many women will have an abortion in their lifetime — at least 1 in 4, according to theGuttmacher Institute— she talked about something else. Stalling. Then she said it: ""I had a safe, legal abortion. I hope you continue to have that right."" The class got quiet. Ida felt bold because she said something hard to say out loud. I asked her why she decided to share? ""Because stories help people understand each other,” she told me. “Stories can lead to political change."" As the two of us talked, we got enraged. We Googled ""Men’s Abortion Stories,"" and it was autocorrected to ""Women’s Abortion Stories."" We screamed over the phone like we were at a rally again. We have never seen a man stand up at a pro-choice rally and say, ""I’m so glad abortion is legal because I didn’t want to be a father."" Men never have to admit how relieved they feel once an abortion is over. They don’t have to worry about being judged irresponsible, a whore or a murderer. Women areconstantly telling our stories, making us vulnerable. And we should. We need to humanize the experience and let lawmakers — the public — know that abortion affects everyone. But men should tell their stories for the same reasons. Did birth control fail you? Did you refuse to wear a condom? Did the baby you and your partner were expecting get diagnosed as nonviable? Did you have other plans besides fatherhood when you got her pregnant? How has abortion helped you? I’m talking to men who claim to care about women, men who claim to want to keep abortion safe and legal, and men who benefit from abortion. These stories hardly exist publicly, but we know they are there. Ida and I created a hashtag to help men tell their stories: #MensAbortionStories. For real change to occur, men need to tell their stories publicly. Men also need to tell these stories to each other. Wherever men talk — in locker rooms, boardrooms, dining rooms, congressional hearing rooms — they need to tell the truth: ""My partner had a safe, legal abortion. I hope we continue to have that right."" ",0
"U.S. District Judge Matthew Kacsmaryk’sdecision to put the Food and Drug Administration’s approval of the abortion drug mifepristone on holdhas thrown future access to medication abortion into question nationwide and laid thefoundation for a high-stakes Supreme Court battle. The ruling, issued Friday, is set to go into effect at the end of this week unless a higher court intervenes. The Justice Departmentasked an appeals court to block itMonday. In interviews, several legal and medical experts said Kacsmaryk’s decision was unprecedented and clearly ideological. His language and reasoning, they said, closely mirrored arguments and concepts put forward by the anti-abortion movement — at the expense of scientific consensus in some instances. The experts pointed to several key examples of the extreme nature of Kacsmaryk’s 67-page ruling, including his use of politicized terminology and apparent endorsement of the contentious idea of ""fetal personhood."" Here are the parts of the ruling experts found most striking. Kacsmaryk, a Trump appointee, earlier in his career represented a Christian conservative legal group that sued the federal government challenging the part of the Affordable Care Act that required employers to provide free insurance coverage for birth control. In his ruling Friday, Kacsmaryk used various terms closely associated with the anti-abortion movement, according to the experts who were interviewed. Notably, Kacsmaryk referred to the two-pill regimen that is the most common way to terminate a pregnancy in the U.S. as ""chemical abortion,"" rather than ""medication abortion."" The plaintiffs in the suit, a group called the Alliance for Hippocratic Medicine, use the same term in their filings and messaging. ""'Chemical abortion' is absolutely not a scientific or medical term. It is something that has been utilized and propagated by those who want to ban abortion or restrict abortion,"" said Dr. Jenni Villavicencio, an OB-GYN who is the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists’ lead for equity transformation. Villavicencio characterized ""chemical abortion"" as an ""emotive"" term meant to inspire fear about the risks of ending a pregnancy. She also highlighted Kacsmaryk’s references to a fetus as an ""unborn human"" or an ""unborn child."" Kacsmaryk wrote that mifepristone ""blocks the hormone progesterone, halts nutrition, and ultimately starves the unborn human until death."" Plenty of pregnant women use the phrase ""unborn child"" to describe their experiences, Villavicencio said, but it ""certainly is not a scientific term, and it is not a term that should be used when discussing science and medicine."" Kacsmaryk’s language implies a belief about when life begins — a question that continues to roil American society. Medical experts generally recognize around 24 weeks’ gestation as the point at which a fetus is able to survive outside the womb. Kacsmaryk’s references to an ""unborn child"" align with other parts of his decision in which he suggests that any potential ""side effects"" or ""significant complications"" caused by mifepristone should apply to both the pregnant woman and ""to the unborn humans extinguished by mifepristone."" Such wording, experts said, references the concept of ""fetal personhood"": the idea promoted by the anti-abortion movement that a fetus should be recognized as a person with constitutional rights from the moment of conception. Under that theory — which many legal analysts and abortion rights advocates oppose — an abortion would be considered murder. ""You will not find in the federal Constitution any terminology about embryo,"" said Michele Goodwin, a professor of law at the University of California, Irvine, adding: ""You will not find the term 'fetus.' You will not find the term 'unborn child.'"" The FDA approved mifepristone in 2000 under a regulatory provision called Subpart H, which allows for accelerated approval of drugs that studies have shown are safe and effective for treating serious illnesses. The provision was used not to fast-track the drug’s approval, theKaiser Family Foundation recently reported, but rather to regulate who could dispense the pills and where. (At that time, mifepristone could be given only by or under the supervision of a qualified doctor.) In his ruling, Kacsmaryk argued that Subpart H shouldn’t have applied to mifepristone because pregnancy is a ""normal physiological state most women experience one or more times."" The plaintiffs highlighted the same argument in a statement after the decision. ""Pregnancy is not an illness, and chemical abortion drugs don’t provide a therapeutic benefit. … The FDA never had the authority to approve these hazardous drugs,"" said Erik Baptist, a senior council for the Alliance Defending Freedom, which represents the plaintiffs. But Mary Ziegler, a law professor at the University of California, Davis, and a historian who has studied the U.S. abortion debate, pushed back against that premise. ""Obviously people do suffer complications and death from pregnancy, especially in the United States, which has by far the highest maternal mortality rate in the developed world,"" Ziegler said.(A National Center for Health Statisticsreport last monthfound that the U.S. maternal mortality rate rose significantly in 2021 compared to the two previous years.) Villavicencio said pregnancy can be thought of both as a natural state for women to enter and as a medical condition that requires specialized care. ""There is a reason why insurance covers it. There’s a reason why there are physicians that train half their lives in order to treat people who are pregnant — because it absolutely is a condition that is different than not being pregnant,"" she said, adding, ""I think it really flies in the face of fact and understanding to suggest that it is not potentially a dangerous condition."" In defending the FDA, Justice Department lawyers have questioned whether the group that sued has the standing to do so. To bring a lawsuit, a party must be able to show that it has suffered an injury. Attorney Erin Morrow Hawley argued on behalf of the plaintiffs at a hearing last month that mifepristone’s approval has harmed some doctors because it forces them, ""contrary to their most deeply-held ethical, medical, and religious convictions, to participate and finish elective abortions."" Kacsmaryk agreed, concluding that ""adverse events from chemical abortion drugs can overwhelm the medical system and place 'enormous pressure and stress' on doctors during emergencies and complications."" But Ziegler questioned that reasoning. Usually, at least one plaintiff needs a ""concrete injury to get standing,"" she said, but in her view, ""we don’t appear to have one here."" Then there’s the question of whether it’s too late to challenge the FDA’s approval 22 years later. Kacsmaryk said the plaintiffs can still sue because the FDA changed its rules about mifepristone in 2016 and 2021, thereby reopening its approval to challenges.",0
"More than 200 biopharma groups, which include a number of drugmakers led by Pfizer, have signed an open letter blasting the decision by Texas federal Judge Matthew Kacsmaryk to issue a hold on federal approval of mifepristone, the most commonly used method of abortion in the U.S. The lettercriticized Kacsmaryk for having issued the ruling despite having ""no scientific training"" and said his decision has ""undermined the bipartisan authority granted by Congress to the Food and Drug Administration to approve and regulate safe, effective medicines for every American."" ""The decision ignores decades of scientific evidence and legal precedent,"" the drugmakers wrote. ""Judge Kacsmaryk’s act of judicial interference has set a precedent for diminishing FDA’s authority over drug approvals, and in so doing, creates uncertainty for the entire biopharma industry."" In addition to Pfizer CEO Albert Bourla, the letter was signed by representatives for Merck and Biogen, as well as industry nonprofit groups like the Center for Medicine in the Public Interest. In his ruling last week, Kacsmaryk sided with an anti-abortion group that had challenged the FDA's decades-old approval of the drug. ""The Court does not second-guess FDA’s decision-making lightly,"" Kacsmaryk wrote in his decision. ""But here, FDA acquiesced on its legitimate safety concerns — in violation of its statutory duty — based on plainly unsound reasoning and studies that did not support its conclusions."" The case is likely to make its way to the Supreme Court. Separately, the primary lobbying arm of the pharmaceutical industry, PhRMA, issued a statement Monday saying Kacsmaryk's ruling undermines the regulatory process.",0
"North Carolina Republican legislative leaders said on Tuesday there’s agreement in the GOP-dominated legislature on backing a measure that wouldprohibit abortionin nearly all cases after roughly the first trimester of pregnancy. House Speaker Tim Moore and Senate leader Phil Berger announced at an early-evening news conference that there’s consensus between Republicans in the state House and Senate. North Carolina law currently bansnearly allabortionsafter 20 weeks of pregnancy. The measure would reduce that to 12 weeks, with new exceptions in cases of rape, incest or fetal abnormality. An existing exception for when the life of the pregnant woman is in danger would remain. Final votes for the agreed-upon legislation would occur Wednesday in the House and Thursday in the Senate, legislators said. The bill also contains provisions to make adoptions easier and to improve health care access for children and pregnant women. “It’s time for North Carolina to take the next step forward in honoring the sanctity of human life,” said Sen. Joyce Krawiec, a Forsyth County Republican and one of the negotiators of the agreement, adding that the bill “will undoubtedly save lives and improve health outcomes for many pregnant women.” The final measure would go to the desk of Democratic Gov. Roy Cooper, who is a strong supporter of abortion rights. He said in December he would consider it extreme to ban abortion after less than 20 weeks. In a fundraising email to supporters late Tuesday, Cooper called the bill “an egregious, unacceptable attack on the women of our state.” Cooper campaigned last fall for legislative candidates that he said would help uphold his vetoes on abortion. But Republicans now hold veto-proof majorities in both General Assembly chambers after then-Democratic Rep. Tricia Cotham, of Mecklenburg County, switched to the Republican Party last month. Cotham has declined to say publicly whether she would be willing to vote for new restrictions. If she doesn’t vote for the bill, some House Democrats likely would have to vote for an override or be absent for Republicans to overcome a Cooper veto. According to legislators, the bill will place limits on the exceptions, capping abortions at 20 weeks in cases of rape or incest and 24 weeks for “life-limiting” fetal anomalies, including certain physical or genetic disorders that can be diagnosed prenatally. Doctors could face fines for failing to follow some restrictions in the measure. House and Senate Republicans have been working for months toward a consensus to further act upon last year’s U.S. Supreme Court decision overturning Roe v. Wade. At the time of the ruling last June, abortions were legal in North Carolina until fetal viability, which generally falls between 24 and 28 weeks of pregnancy, or in certain medical emergencies. That made North Carolina a locale for abortion access for those traveling from other Southern states where abortion was already banned. A federal judge in August reinstated the unenforced 20-week ban following the Supreme Court’s ruling. At least 88% of the abortions involving North Carolina residents in 2020 occurred at or before 12 weeks of gestation, according to state Department of Health and Human Services data. Planned Parenthood South Atlantic spokesperson Jillian Riley said the restrictions will have “detrimental effects” on the health of North Carolina residents and others from the Southeast. Other critics complained about how the agreement was worked out privately among Republicans over several months without formal public input. “The people of North Carolina are taking witness, they are listening, they are watching,” Riley told reporters. “They do not want any more bans on abortion care. We will remember who voted to strip away legal abortion in North Carolina.” Republican leadership also billed the measure as a $160 million investment in child care access, maternal health care and paid parental leave for teachers and state employees. The bill includes millions of dollars in funding for foster care families and parents who are working to finish community college. The money set aside also would go to nonprofit community health centers to provide contraceptives to underserved, uninsured or medically indigent patients.",2
"Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., is calling on a chief judge in a Texas federal court to make changes to case assignment practices in order to prevent ""forum shopping"" by litigants who he says are able to effectively hand-pick judges to hear their civil cases. The current practice has led to ""chaotic and flawed rulings on abortion access, LGBTQ+ protections, legal immigration, and climate legislation,"" Schumer said. Schumer made the request Thursday in aletter to Chief Judge David Godbeyof the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of Texas, where a judge recently ordered thesuspension of the Food and Drug Administration's longtime approval of the key abortion medication mifepristone. The top Senate Democrat argued that the district court's current practice in assigning cases often results in a single judge hearing cases from their divisions, rather than evenly distributing and randomly assigning the cases. He expressed concern that as a result, plaintiffs who file lawsuits take advantage of that system and are able to effectively choose judges who might rule in their favor. Schumer urged Godbey to change that given his authority to decide how cases are assigned to judges in his district. ""Even though the Northern District has twelve active judges and another four senior judges who still hear cases, your orders provide that civil cases filed in many divisions are always assigned to a single judge, or to one of just a few,"" the letter said. Cases filed in the Amarillo division, Schumer said, are ""always assigned to Judge [Matthew] Kacsmaryk,"" a controversial Donald Trump appointee who issued the abortion medication ruling. The Supreme Court last weekblocked the decision from taking effect, allowing the abortion pill to remain on the market while litigation continues in the 5th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals. ""As a result of your recent assignment orders, plaintiffs in your district can now effectively choose the judge who will hear their cases,"" Schumer wrote to Godbey. ""Unsurprisingly, litigants have taken advantage of these orders to hand-pick individual district judges seen as particularly sympathetic to their claims."" The Senate leader pointed to district courts with rural divisions that ""divide civil cases randomly between all their judges, regardless of where the case is filed,"" such as in his home state of New York. The Northern District of New York, which covers upstate and central New York, randomly divides all cases between all of its judges in all divisions, he noted. ""A litigant in the Northern District of New York therefore cannot pick its judge by filing suit in Plattsburgh instead of Utica,"" he said. Schumer noted that a federal statute allows each district court to decide how cases are assigned, which provides for flexibility. But he warned, ""if that flexibility continues to allow litigants to hand-pick their preferred judges and effectively guarantee their preferred outcomes, Congress will consider more prescriptive requirements.""",2
"JusticeSamuel Alitohas said he has a ""pretty good idea"" who was responsible for theleakofhis unpublisheddraft opinionlast year, which indicated that the Supreme Court was poised to roll back abortion rights, but does not have the proof needed to name somebody. In an interview with James Taranto,The Wall Street Journal's editorial features editor, which was published Friday, Alito said: “I personally have a pretty good idea who is responsible, but that’s different from the level of proof that is needed to name somebody. “It was a part of an effort to prevent the Dobbsdraft ... from becoming the decision of the court. And that’s how it was used for those six weeks by people on the outside — as part of the campaign to try to intimidate the court,"" he said. The unprecedented leak, first published by Politico, ignited a firestorm of protests from supporters of abortion rights alarmed at the prospect that the court was preparing to overturn the constitutional right to abortion enshrined 50 years ago in Roe v. Wade. In the aftermath of the leak, Democratic congressional leadersvowed to push for a federal lawthat would codify abortion rights. Alito, who was nominated by former President George W. Bush, wrote the draft as well as the eventual Supreme Court opinion that overturned Roe in June 2022. In January, following alengthy investigation, the Supreme Court announced that it could notconclusively identifywho had leaked the unpublished draft. In an unsigned statement, the court said that it had followed up on all leads and that forensic analysis had been performed, but “the team has to date been unable to identify a person responsible by a preponderance of the evidence.” The investigation was largely limited to the court building and the people who work within it, meaning any actions anyone took at home or elsewhere using personal devices were mostly not within its scope. The Supreme Court's marshal, Gail Curley, who conducted the investigation, said that 97 court employees were interviewed and all denied being the leaker. She also said it was unlikely the court’s information technology systems were compromised. Curley did not immediately respond to a request for comment on Alito's remarks to The Wall Street Journal. In the months following the leak of the draft abortion opinion, there were protests at the homes of some justices. Alito said last year that the leak hadendangered the lives of justicesby putting a target on their backs. He referred to the charges against Nicholas John Roske, of Simi Valley, California, who wasarmedwith a handgun, a knife, pepper spray and burglary tools when he was arrested last June near Justice Brett Kavanaugh’s home, between the release of the leaked draft and the court’s eventual ruling. “The leak also made those of us who were thought to be in the majority in support of overruling Roe and Casey targets for assassination, because it gave people a rational reason to think they could prevent that from happening by killing one of us,” Alito said in October.

"A 19th century “anti-vice” law is at the center of anew court ruling that threatens access to the leading abortion drugin the U.S. Dormant for a half-century, the Comstock Act has been revived byanti-abortion groups and conservative statesseeking to block the mailing of mifepristone, the pill used in more than half of U.S. abortions. On Friday, a federal judge in Texas sided with Christian conservatives in ruling that the Comstock Act prohibits sending the long-used drug through the mail. Here’s a look at the case and the law: In a sweeping ruling, U.S. District Judge Matthew J. Kacsmaryk said that the Food and Drug Administration’s approval of mifepristone more than two decades ago violated federal rules. Despite overwhelming evidence to the contrary, the Donald Trump appointee said the FDA overlooked “legitimate safety concerns” with the pill, which has been available since 2000. The Biden administration and mifepristone’s main drugmaker filed appeals notices within hours of the decision. The Texas ruling came almost simultaneously with an order from a judge in Washington state, who said the FDA must maintain access to the drug in Democratic-led states that filed their own lawsuit. The dueling opinions are expected to send the matter quickly to the Supreme Court. A former lawyer for the conservative First Liberty Institute, Kacsmaryk used the terminology of anti-abortion advocates throughout his opinion, referring to doctors who prescribe mifepristone as “abortionists,” fetuses as “unborn humans” and medication abortions as “chemical” abortions. If upheld, Kacsmaryk’s 67-page decision would also dismantle recent FDA changes designed to ease access to mifepristone, particularly a 2021 switch that allowed the drug to be sent through the mail. Originally passed in 1873 and named for an anti-vice crusader, the Comstock Act was intended to prohibit the mailing of contraceptives, “lewd” writings and any “instrument, substance, drug, medicine, or thing” that could be used in an abortion. The law’s scope has been repeatedly narrowed by federal courts and Congress, which eliminated the reference to contraceptives in the 1970s. And the federal government hasn’t enforced the law since the 1930s, according to legal experts. Kacsmaryk, though, agreed with plaintiffs that the law — as literally interpreted — prohibits mailing mifepristone. The FDA’s decision allowing the “dispensing of chemical abortion drugs through mail violates unambiguous federal criminal law,” he concluded. The law was essentially dormant in the 50 years after Roe v. Wade established a federal right to abortion. And untilthe FDA loosened its requirements on mifepristone in 2021, there was no real way to enable abortion through the mail. But Rachel Rebouché of Temple University’s law school says anti-abortion groups — emboldened bythe Supreme Court decision overturning of Roe— have seized on Comstock to try and shut off the flow of abortion drugs. “The fact that pills can be mailed is an existential crisis for the anti-abortion movement — it’s hard to police, it’s hard to track, it’s difficult to enforce,” said Rebouché. “If courts are willing to breathe new life into Comstock, it has the potential to shut down the uptake of medication abortion across the country.” Comstock has also been cited by Republican state officials seeking to stop national pharmacy chains from shipping abortion pills to their states. In February, attorneys general in 20 conservative-led stateswarned CVS and Walgreensthat they could face legal consequences if they sell abortion pills by mail in their states. Most of those states have laws restricting abortion broadly or the pills specifically, but the attorneys general said mail-order mifepristone also runs afoul of the Comstock Act. Beginning in the 1930s, federal courts issued rulings drastically narrowing how the law could be applied. Read literally, the law could be interpreted to outlaw almost any medical item that could be used in an abortion. “The interpretation being advanced would apply to all kinds of articles — like surgical gloves — that are just basic equipment for health care,” Rebouché said. A key 1936 ruling concluded that the law could only apply when the person mailing an item or drug specifically intended it to be used illegally for abortion. In December, the Biden administration’s Justice Department attempted to bolster that interpretation, issuing an opinion that Comstock could not be used to outlaw the mailing of abortion pills because of their many legal uses, including during miscarriages and under abortion-ban exceptions. Again, Kacsmaryk rejected that view, stating that the law “plainly does not require intent on the part of the seller.” The Supreme Court has never weighed in on Comstock and — assuming the justices take up the case— the ruling could have far-reaching consequences for American women, abortion providers and their opponents. Kacsmaryk’s order is limited to mifepristone, but the same approach could potentially be used for other drugs. Mifepristone is currentlytaken in combination with a second pill,misoprostol. Abortion clinics have said that if mifepristone were pulled from the market, they would switch to using only the second drug, which is also used to treat other medical conditions. But whether Comstock could be used to also curtail shipments of misoprostol is not clear, since it is widely prescribed for stomach ulcers and other uses. Even if the Supreme Court affirms the Texas ruling and orders mifepristone off the market, experts say there could be more legal battles ahead. The FDA has its own procedures for revoking drug approvals, which involve public hearings and internal agency reviews. The process can take months or years. If those steps are skipped, mifepristone-maker Danco Laboratories, which is a party to the case, could potentially sue under “due process” claims, according to experts. The FDA is also facing pressure to essentially ignore a negative court decision, given there is almost no legal precedent for a judge overruling the agency’s medical determinations. “There is no way this decision has a basis in law,” said Democratic Sen. Ron Wyden, of Oregon, in a statement Friday. “The FDA, doctors, and pharmacies can and must go about their jobs like nothing has changed.” Legal experts point out that the FDA has traditionally had broad leeway in deciding how to use its authority. For instance, the agency allows a number of unproven remedies and supplements to remain on the market because they are essentially harmless and removing them would drain limited agency resources. Given that mifepristone remains safe and effective for ending pregnancy, some experts say the agency should simply allow the pill to remain on the market as an unapproved medication.",2
"Federal authorities Tuesday arrested a man they say firebombed an anti-abortion group after the FBI used DNA it pulled from a partly eaten burrito to connect him to the Mason jar used in the attack. Hridindu Sankar Roychowdhury was arrested Tuesday in Boston and charged in connection with the firebombing of the office of Wisconsin Family Action in Madison on May 8. “If abortions aren’t safe then you aren’t either,"" someone had written on the wall of the building in graffiti during the attack, which took place just days after Politicobroke the newsthat the Supreme Court had the votes to overturn Roe v. Wade. Authorities were able to pull DNA off of a Mason jar they found inside, as well as from the window glass and on a lighter found at the scene, a Dane County deputy who serves on a FBI Joint Terrorism Task Force wrote in anaffidavit. There were no hits on the DNA in a national database. But Wisconsin State Capitol Police monitoring a protest on Jan. 21 saw multiple people spray-painting in a ""cursive-style writing"" that had ""visual similarities"" to the graffiti outside the Wisconsin Family Action office, the affidavit stated. Using security video, they identified the owner of a white pickup truck that was seen leaving a parking garage near where the protesters had been spray-painting. The truck belonged to a person who lived at Roychowdhury's address. Early this month, law enforcement officers watched Roychowdhury toss a brown fast-food bag on top of a trash bin in a parking lot. Authorities recovered the bag, which contained ""a quarter portion of a partially eaten burrito wrapped in waxed paper, a soiled napkin, a crumpled napkin, a stack of napkins, the wrapper of the burrito, a crumpled food wrapper, four unopened hot sauce packets,"" according to the affidavit. The evidence was sent to a laboratory of the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives, and law enforcement officials ""swabbed the burrito for DNA and sent the swab to the ATF lab."" The results came back March 17: The DNA from the Wisconsin Family Action crime scene matched the DNA from the partly eaten burrito. Roychowdhury was arrested at Boston Logan International Airport on Tuesday; authorities said he had purchased a one-way ticket to Guatemala City. A detention hearing was scheduled at a federal court in Boston on Tuesday afternoon, and court records indicate that the government moved for his detention. Another hearing is set for Thursday. At a recent Senate hearing, Republican senators repeatedly asked Attorney General Merrick Garland why there had been no charges yet in recent firebomb attacks at anti-abortion facilities, suggesting that the Justice Department was prioritizing investigating other crimes. Garland contended that the attacks happened under the cover of night and that the Justice Department continued to look for the assailants.",2
